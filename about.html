        <h1>About Pharaoh Motors</h1>
        <p>
            Founded in the heart of Alexandria in 1960 by the visionary engineer Ahmed Ragab, Car Factory was born from a simple yet powerful dream: to build a car for every Egyptian family.
             In an era of industrial growth, Ragab saw an opportunity to create a vehicle that was not only robust and reliable enough for our unique roads but also affordable and proud in its design.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first "Nile Eagle" model rolled off our assembly line just two years later, marking the beginning of a long journey in automotive excellence and establishing our commitment to quality and national pride.
